Here is a little bit of "about me" which i copy-pasted from my CV:

I am detail-oriented and results-driven professional with over 8 years of experience in the service and hospitality industry, I have a proven track record in enhancing client satisfaction and driving business success. In my previous role as an Assistant Manager at an international hotel chain, I successfully improved the Net Promoter Score (NPS) from 7 to 9 and consistently achieved quarterly sales targets ranging from IDR 1 billion to IDR 2.5 billion.

With a strong passion for data-driven problem-solving, I have effectively utilized tools like Microsoft Excel to analyze data, identify trends, and optimize performance. My hands-on experience in hospitality offers a customer-centric perspective that enhances my ability to deliver actionable insights. I am eager to leverage my analytical skills and industry expertise to make a meaningful impact in a data analyst role.
